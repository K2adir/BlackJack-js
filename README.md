# Blackjack Game

This is a simple Blackjack game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It follows the basic rules of Blackjack, where the player and dealer are dealt two cards each and the goal is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. The player can choose to "hit" and receive another card, or "stand" and keep their current hand. The dealer must continue to hit until their hand reaches 17 points or higher.

# Getting Started

To play the game, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The game will be displayed in the browser window and can be played using the mouse.

# Gameplay

1. Click on the banner when the game is launched. 
2. Set the bet amount. You can bet 0.
3. The player and dealer will be dealt two cards each.
4. The player can choose to hit or stand by clicking the corresponding button.
5. If the player chooses to hit, they will be dealt another card.
6. If the player chooses to stand, the dealer will start hitting until their hand reaches 17 points or higher.
7. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21 points, the player wins the game.
8. If the dealer's hand is higher than the player's hand without exceeding 21 points, the player loses the game.
9. If the player and dealer have the same score, the game is a "push" and the player's bet is returned.
